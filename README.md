# Red Hat CNCF Landscape (experimental)

This repository is a working fork of the CNCF [landscape2](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2) tooling.  
Our goal is to prototype how the CNCF Landscape could look and feel when it is themed for Red Hat audiences while retaining the product behaviour that already exists in landscape2.

The project currently focuses on:

- Applying a Red Hat-aligned color palette without losing the canonical Red Hat highlight (the bright `#ee0000`)
- Tweaking layout behaviour so Red Hat supported projects remain visually distinct across desktop and mobile screens
- Curating content groups and messaging that better match what Red Hat wants to showcase
- Experimenting with headers, favicons, and calls-to-action to make sure a branded experience feels cohesive

⚠️ The work here is exploratory. Configuration, colours, and copy will keep evolving until we are happy with the
result. Treat the repo as a sandbox rather than a reusable product.

Ideas, issues, or requests? Open a PR or ping the maintainers. This is an experiment—feedback is welcome.
